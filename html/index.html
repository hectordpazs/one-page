                    <p>The story of The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time revolves around the Gerudo King and evil wizard Ganondorf's rise to power and the hero's quest to defeat him and bring peace to the land of Hyrule. The game opens with the hero's mentor and protector, The Great Deku Tree, sending a fairy, Navi, to inform the hero about his new responsibilities. After gathering the necessary equipment, Navi escorts the hero to the Great Deku Tree who explains that Ganondorf has come to the land of Hyrule and is vying for power. He tells the hero that Ganondorf has cursed him and then proceeds to ask the hero to break the curse. The hero then enters the Great Deku Tree. Inside, he receives the Fairy Slingshot and fights his way to the dungeon's boss and source of the curse, Queen Gohma, the Parasitic Armored Arachnid, and defeats her.
                    
                    After the hero's success, the Great Deku Tree reveals that even though Link's efforts were successful, he was doomed from the start. He then tells the tale of Ganondorf and the Triforce, and tells the hero he must travel to Hyrule Castle to meet the Princess Zelda, after which he dies.
                        
                    The hero leaves his home in Kokiri Forest, but is stopped by Saria on the bridge leading out. She gives him the Fairy Ocarina and tells him to remember her. The hero then travels to Hyrule Castle and indeed meets Princess Zelda. She tells him of her dream and about the Spiritual Stones and the Ocarina of Time. She then asks him to collect the other two spiritual stones. After this meeting the hero is taught the song Zelda's Lullaby on his ocarina by Impa who leads him out of the castle and shows him the way to Kakariko Village, which lies beneath the Gorons' home in Death Mountain. He meets the leader of the Gorons, Darunia and helps him deal with a problem in Dodongo's Cavern. Afterward, Darunia gives him the Spiritual Stone of Fire or Goron's Ruby in return. The hero then travels to Zora's Domain where he saves Ruto of the Zora's. She then gives him the Spiritual Stone of Water or Zora's Sapphire in return and mentions it to be an engagement ring. The hero then hurries back to Hyrule Castle. At the gate, however, he is stopped by Zelda who is riding away with Impa as if escaping. The Princess manages to throw an object to the hero before disappearing into the distance. Ganondorf then comes out of the town and asks about the direction the Princess went. The hero attempts to confront him and Ganondorf defeats him easily then rides off. The hero retrieves the object which is in fact the Ocarina of Time and learns how to play the Song of Time. He continues, undaunted, to the Temple of Time where he opens the Door of Time and finds the Master Sword.

                    <p>The story of The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask The game starts with Link, now the Hero of Time from Ocarina of Time, looking for Navi in the Lost Woods. Two fairies, Tatl and Tael, startle Epona and Link is knocked out after falling off. A Skull Kid wearing a mysterious mask appears and steals Epona and the Ocarina of Time then rides into the woods. Link then follows Skull Kid into a mysterious tree. Link rushes into the tree only to find out that there was a pit, which he fell into. He then lands in a dark room, lit up only by torches and an eerie light emitted by the ceiling.

                    The Skull Kid turns Link into a Deku Scrub and leaves but accidentally leaves Tatl behind. Deku Link and Tatl follow them into Clock Tower. They meet the Happy Mask Salesman, who tells them that if they can get Majora's Mask and the Ocarina of Time back in three days, he can turn Link back into a Hylian. Link learns the Skull Kid has caused mischief across the new world he entered (Called Termina) and that he is trying to make the Moon to fall and destroy the world at the end of the third day.
                        
                    Link gets the Ocarina of Time back and uses the Song of Time to transport him and Tatl back to the dawn of the first day. The Happy Mask Salesman turns Link back to a Hylian, leaving a mask behind to let him turn back to the Deku Scrub whenever he wants. Link then must awaken the four giants to prevent the Moon from falling and repeat the three days over and over until he succeeds. After saving the Deku Princess and removing the poison from the Southern Swamp, bringing the Snowhead region back to spring, saving the Zora eggs and clearing the fog from Great Bay, and bringing peace to souls in Ikana Canyon, the giants that Link awakened stop the Moon from crashing into Termina, but it is revealed that Majora's Mask had possessed Skull Kid and it then gives more power to the moon. Link goes into the moon where he defeats Majora's Mask with the help of the Fierce Deity's Mask if he chooses to get it. Link then returns to Hyrule and continues his search for Navi.

                    <p>Long ago, the Goddess Hylia rescued her people from a great evil by sending them to the sky. Here, in Skyloft, they lived until the land below had been virtually forgotten, until the evil begins to resurface and plucks Zelda from the sky. Link, her childhood friend, must go down to the surface and prevent Lord Ghirahim from using her to fully revive his master. This story is a precursor to many elements in Ocarina of Time, such as the Master Sword.

                    <p>Link awakens to the call of an unfamiliar voice after a long slumber, with no memory of his identity or whereabouts. Venturing outside the Shrine of Resurrection onto the Great Plateau, the strange voice gives Link instructions to make his way to the point on his map. Along the way, Link meets a mysterious Old Man, who seems to know more about Link and his past than he initially reveals. After completing a series of challenges tasked to him by the Old Man, Link embarks upon a journey to restore his memories, learn about the past, confront Calamity Ganon residing in Hyrule Castle and restore peace to Hyrule.
